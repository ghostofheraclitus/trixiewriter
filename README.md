# TrixieWriter

## What is TrixieWriter?
TrixieWriter is a simple tool for writing stories with a limited wordlist. 

Specifically, it is meant for writing stores for the daughter of [Bookplayer](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/26449/bookplayer), awesome My Little Pony fan. Her daughter has issues learning how to speak and communicates using an assisted communication app on her tablet that has a limited wordlist.

The purpose of this tool is to allow anyone to write stories for Trixie (it is also compatible with poems, riddles, and instructions on how to take over the world) easily. Its main function right now is to highlight words that don't appear on the wordlist, though others might be added in the future. 

If you wish to write lines that aren't checked for Trixie-Correctness it supports comments. Just start a line with # and it will ignore everything past that. 

## Technical details

**THE CODE IS AN UNHOLY MESS AND IT JUST BARELY WORKS**

This concludes the technical details. 

Seriously, though, the current version is hammered together from scrap wood and rusty nails. It needs to be rewritten using a code editor component for React or something of this nature since highlighting text in a textarea is, it turns out, damn near impossible. I found a JQuery component that does it, just, but it is buggy as all hell and it needs replacing. If anyone wants to tweak this or anything, ask and I am happy to lend a hand as far as I am able.
